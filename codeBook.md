## The final data set (tidydata.txt) contains the following variables:


"V1" - activity_labels:

Variable containing the six activities performed by 30 volunters with ages between 19-48 years: 
(WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING).

"V2" - subject:

Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

#### The following variables was obtained from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ 
and tGyro-XYZ. Where the prefix "t"denotes time, tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ denote body and gravity 
acceleration signals respectivaly. 

"V3" - tBodyAcc-mean()-X

"V4" - tBodyAcc-mean()-Y

"V5" - tBodyAcc-mean()-Z

"V6" - tBodyAcc-std()-X

"V7" - tBodyAcc-std()-Y

"V8" - tBodyAcc-std()-Z

"V9"  - tGravityAcc-mean()-X

"V10" - tGravityAcc-mean()-Y

"V11" - tGravityAcc-mean()-Z

"V12" - tGravityAcc-std()-X

"V13" - tGravityAcc-std()-Y

"V14" - tGravityAcc-std()-Z

#### Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

"V15" - tBodyAccJerk-mean()-X

"V16" - tBodyAccJerk-mean()-Y

"V17" - tBodyAccJerk-mean()-Z

"V18" - tBodyAccJerk-std()-X

"V19" - tBodyAccJerk-std()-Y

"V20" - tBodyAccJerk-std()-Z

"V21" - tBodyGyro-mean()-X
  
"V22" - tBodyGyro-mean()-Y
  
"V23" - tBodyGyro-mean()-Z
  
"V24" - tBodyGyro-std()-X

"V25" - tBodyGyro-std()-Y

"V26" - tBodyGyro-std()-Z

"V27" - tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-X
  
"V28" - tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-Y
  
"V29" - tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-Z

"V30" - tBodyGyroJerk-std()-X

"V31" - tBodyGyroJerk-std()-Y

"V32" - tBodyGyroJerk-std()-Z

"V33" - tBodyAccMag-mean()

"V34" - tBodyAccMag-std()

"V35" - tGravityAccMag-mean()

"V36" - tGravityAccMag-std()

"V37" - tBodyAccJerkMag-mean()

"V38" - tBodyAccJerkMag-std()

"V39" - tBodyGyroMag-mean()

"V40" - tBodyGyroMag-std()

"V41" - tBodyGyroJerkMag-mean()

"V42" - tBodyGyroJerkMag-std()

#### Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

"V43" - fBodyAcc-mean()-X

"V44" - fBodyAcc-mean()-Y

"V45" - fBodyAcc-mean()-Z

"V46" - fBodyAcc-std()-X

"V47" - fBodyAcc-std()-Y

"V48" - fBodyAcc-std()-Z

"V49" - fBodyAccJerk-mean()-X

"V50" - fBodyAccJerk-mean()-Y

"V51" - fBodyAccJerk-mean()-Z

"V52" - fBodyAccJerk-std()-X

"V53" - fBodyAccJerk-std()-Y

"V54" - fBodyAccJerk-std()-Z

"V55" - fBodyGyro-mean()-X

"V61" - fBodyAccMag-mean()

"V62" - fBodyAccMag-std()

"V63" - fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-mean()

"V64" - fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-std()

"V65" - fBodyBodyGyroMag-mean()

"V66" - fBodyBodyGyroMag-std()
